# `repo` manifests

Setting up a `oniro` workspace is done using the `repo` tool which in turn uses
the included manifest files for project definitions. These define and set
upstream components (for example
[oe-core](https://git.openembedded.org/openembedded-core/)). For detailed
information on how to setup a `repo` workspace, checkout the
[documentation](https://docs.oniroproject.org/).
