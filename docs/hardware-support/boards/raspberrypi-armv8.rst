Overview
********

The platform adds explicit support for Raspberry Pi 4 boards in 64-bit mode.
You can read more about that support in :ref:`raspberrypi`.

While doing so, the |main_project_name| integration provides extra support on
the same image for other 64-bit, ARMv8, capable Raspberry Pi boards. For
example, an image generated for Raspberry Pi 4 will work as well on a Raspberry
Pi 3 (in 64 bit mode). You can check more details of the 64-bit support in the
official Raspberry Pi `documentation
<https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/config_txt.html#arm_64bit>`_.
